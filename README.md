# Zhihu-labels-classification-by-using-Wikidata-identifiers
We propose a novel rule-based approach to achieve the hierarchical topic classification for content from different platforms by utilizing Wikidata on-tology. More specifically, we conduct an experiment on Zhihu (the largest Chinese Q&A platform). By mapping the labels of the questions from Zhihu to Wikidata entities, we can rely on the taxonomic relations from Wikidata to categorize the question topics in a coarse-to-fine manner according to their domain coverage. The proposed topic classification scheme can be applied to classify the items with Wikidata identifiers from different platforms uni-formly. This research also sheds light on how the structured knowledge base can help social media or knowledge-sharing platforms to build a more stand-ardized content classification system.
